# Belly Button Diversity

## Overview

Improbable Beef is collecting data to identify potential bacteria species (OTUs) that may aid in manufacturing synthetic beef. Samples were collected from volunteer's belly buttons and analyzed to identify which species and how much of each bacteria were present.



## Interactivity

This dashboard was created to allow for easy exploration of the test subject data. Select a Test Subject ID number to see a data table of demographic information about each subject, a horizontal bar chart of top 10 bacteria found, a gauge chart of belly button washing frequency, and a bubble chart of all the bacteria found in the subject's sample.

## Customizations

An introductory paragraph was added to give some context to the project as well as some information on how to use the dashboard. Information was also added under each chart describing or detailing what information is being displayed. In addition, all color themes were changed to a predominantly blue color scale for aesthetics.
